# Prouduct-Landing-Page-Project
Within this repository, I have my first attempt at building a website from scratch. I was tasked with creating a product landing page for a project and I wanted to expand and attempt a storefront for a shoe-resell business. 

I coded the web store in HTML and CSS, as I wanted to practice everything I had learned so far and apply it all within one single project. 

Within this project, I also wanted to show my ability to successfully use CSS to build an acceptable site aesthetically.
