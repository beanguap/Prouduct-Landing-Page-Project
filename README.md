# Prouduct-Landing-Page-Project
This repository showcases my first attempt in developing a website from scratch. I was presented with the challenge of constructing a product landing page for a project, and I took the opportunity to push myself further by venturing into the creation of a storefront for a shoe-resell business.

To build this web store, I employed my proficiency in HTML and CSS, harnessing my knowledge to effectively combine all the essential components into one comprehensive project. My aim was to practice my acquired skills and knowledge while simultaneously demonstrating my capabilities in a single undertaking.

Moreover, I leveraged my skillset in CSS to craft an aesthetically pleasing website, showcasing my ability to create a visually appealing and professional-looking site.
